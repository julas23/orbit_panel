# Orbit Panel

A desktop panel and dock for Linux, written in **Rust** with **GTK4** and fully themeable through **CSS**.

Orbit Panel is a ground-up rewrite of an existing panel/dock setup built on [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww). The goal is to keep the flexibility of CSS-based styling while gaining the performance, type safety, and maintainability of a native Rust application.

> **Status:** early development. The panel and dock run on X11 and Wayland with a clock, an app-menu button and launchers; most modules are still to come. APIs, configuration format, and features are all subject to change.

## Goals

- **Native and lightweight** — a single Rust binary, no scripting runtime or polling shell scripts.
- **CSS-first theming** — the entire look and feel is defined in a user stylesheet, with live reload.
- **Panel + dock** — a top/bottom panel and an application dock, both anchored to screen edges.
- **X11 and Wayland** — a backend abstraction: EWMH dock hints and struts on X11 (tested on bspwm), the layer-shell protocol via `gtk4-layer-shell` on Wayland.
- **Easy migration from EWW** — familiar concepts and styling for users coming from an EWW-based setup.

## Planned features

### Panel
- Workspaces indicator
- Focused window title
- Clock and calendar
- System tray
- Audio, network, battery, and other status modules

### Dock
- Pinned and running applications
- Running/focused indicators
- Click to launch or focus

## Building

Requirements:

- Rust (stable, 1.88+) and Cargo
- GTK 4.12+ development files
- `gtk4-layer-shell` development files

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libgtk4-layer-shell-dev
```

Then:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/orbit
```

## Configuration

Orbit reads `~/.config/orbit/config.yaml` (or the path given with `--config`).
Every key is optional; see [`examples/config.yaml`](examples/config.yaml) for
all of them.

Styling goes in `~/.config/orbit/style.css`, which is applied on top of the
[built-in theme](data/style.css) and reloaded automatically when saved.

On X11 the panel and dock reserve their space through `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL`,
so window-manager padding such as bspwm's `left_padding`/`top_padding` is not
needed. Set `reserve: false` to disable this.
